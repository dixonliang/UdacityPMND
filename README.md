# UdacityPMND
In this repository are the four projects for Udacity's Product Manager Nanodegree. I walked through the development process of a fictional fitness application that I took from start to "launch". 

Project 1 (Product Strategy): Conducted research and created presentation on the strategy behind creating a fitness applicaiton and the potential for cost savings to a health care company and potential for attracting new patients

Project 2 (Product Design): Went through the design process, created outline and prototype of the applicaiton as well as main features using tools including Plot.IO and Figma. Prototype mock can be found in the presentation. 

Project 3 (Product Development): Went through a product sprint incorporating AGILE principles. Dealt with hypothetical situations that could come up during the product development process. 

Project 4 (Product Launch): Prepared for a product launch process. Created materials including a PRD, User Guide, Marketing / Pricing Guide, Sales & Customer Support Guide, and Launch Email.
